things i had to do to get this running:
	set the database credentials in .env
	set databaseConfigurationSource to dotEnvFile to get it to use the .env database credentials

improve composerInstall.sh so that it checks for PHP and for Composer and suggests installation instructions for them

add the company/namespace/project name to the back up script message so that it says something like "Back up FooBarCorporation databases" instead of "Back up databases"

interactively ask for database credentials to put in .env during setup

add an option for a base64-encoded password instead of a plain password since some code projects store their credentials this way

make IgnoredDatabaseNames.json optional and document it

create or update a Git repo during setup.php

ask for database port during setup (after getting the database type) and use the default port for that database server by default
