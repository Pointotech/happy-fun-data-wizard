# Happy Fun Data Wizard by Pointotech 🧙‍♂️

Why manually create schemas, model classes, or backups when you can have a wizard do it for you?

## Set up your new adventure 🏰

Let's sprinkle some magic on your project!

Gather your adventuring gear:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Pointotech/happy-fun-data-wizard
cd happy-fun-data-wizard
```

Set out on your new adventure:

```bash
./setup.sh YOUR_PROJECT_PATH
```

This will conjure up a set of scripts and configuration files for the new project.

## Spell of protection 🛡️: back up your data

Safety first! To back up your existing project:

```bash
cd YOUR_PROJECT_PATH
./backUp.sh
```

## Enchant your code 🪄✨✨✨: animate it with the power of magic

Ready to bring your data to life? Just do:

```bash
cd YOUR_PROJECT_PATH
./run.sh
```

## Open the portal 💫: summon your code to its fated realm

Send your magically crafted code to its new home:

```bash
cd YOUR_PROJECT_PATH
./ship.sh
```

Be the wizard of your own data realm!
